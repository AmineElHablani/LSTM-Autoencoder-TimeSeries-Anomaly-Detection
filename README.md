# Anomaly Detection and Time Series Forecasting Using LSTM Autoencoder and Prophet
### Abstract
This project tackles the challenge of anomaly detection in time series data using several advanced techniques. Starting with anomaly detection, we implement methods such as **LSTM Autoencoder**, **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)**, **Isolation Forest**, and **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** to identify anomalies. Each approach is carefully evaluated for its ability to detect irregular patterns and outliers in time series datasets.

For the forecasting component, we focus on predicting **weather in Tunisia**. We employ **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models for this task and utilize the **Facebook Prophet** model for forecasting. We delve into Prophet's parameters to optimize performance and implement a custom **pipeline** similar to GridSearch for automated hyperparameter tuning, further enhancing forecasting accuracy.
