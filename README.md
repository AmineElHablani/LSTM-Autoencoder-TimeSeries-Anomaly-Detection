# LSTM-Autoencoder-TimeSeries-Anomaly-Detection
This project focuses on anomaly detection in time series data using LSTM Autoencoder, MAD, Isolation Forest, and LOF. It also includes time series forecasting using LSTM and Prophet, with detailed exploration of Prophet's parameters and a custom pipeline for optimal parameter tuning, similar to GridSearch.
